Had he remained at Alexandria, his education would have been directed by Jews and along exclusively Jewish lines.

This year he also learned the wisdom of keeping such matters a secret in the family. He was becoming conscious of the way in which he had caused trouble in the village, and henceforth he became increasingly discreet in concealing everything which might cause him to be regarded as different from his fellows.",
