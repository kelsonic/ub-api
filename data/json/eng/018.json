    "htmlText": "These triune rulers of the major sectors are peculiarly perfect in the mastery of administrative details, hence their name <em>— Perfections</em> of Days. In recording the names of these beings of the spiritual world, we are confronted with the problem of translating into your tongue, and very often it is exceedingly difficult to render a satisfactory translation. We dislike to use arbitrary designations which would be meaningless to you; hence we often find it difficult to choose a suitable name, one which will be clear to you and at the same time be somewhat representative of the original."
