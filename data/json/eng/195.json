Christianity presumed to embrace too much for any one people to assimilate in one or two generations.

Christianity came not merely as a new religion—something all the Roman Empire and all the Orient were waiting for—but as a <em>new order of human society.</em> And as such a pretension it quickly precipitated the social-moral clash of the ages.

Even Christianity—the best of the religions of the twentieth century—is not only a religion <em>about</em> Jesus, but it is so largely one which men experience secondhand. They take their religion wholly as handed down by their accepted religious teachers. What an awakening the world would experience if it could only see Jesus as he really lived on earth and know, firsthand, his life-giving teachings! Descriptive words of things beautiful cannot thrill like the sight thereof, neither can creedal words inspire men’s souls like the experience of knowing the presence of God. But expectant faith will ever keep the hope-door of man’s soul open for the entrance of the eternal spiritual realities of the divine values of the worlds beyond.",
